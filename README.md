# UPPD
Introduction

The Slovene Office for anti money laundering yearly under the second paragraph of the 38. artice of the ZPPDFT law (law of anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism) yearly publishes reported transactions from Slovenia to questionable states. Data is fairly disorganized and meanigful queries or transaction investigations are hard to achieve. This set of code uses Maltigo to visualize connections between states and companies. It also produces summaries of transaction activity with few clicks. 

Usage
- Maltego enteties and transforms are stored in UPPD.mtz file,
- Functions and queries are in getCountriesTo.py,
- cleaned and organized data is stored in nakazila_maltego.xls

Note: The transforms do not work without the provided dataset. The direct link to raw data would not produce the desired output (something to work for future development in cooperation with the Office to obtain direct link with organized dataset for transaction query purposes).
